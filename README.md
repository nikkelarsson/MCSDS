# Minecraft-server Download Script

Script that downloads the mc-server.jar from Mojangs website
and after that creates a launch-script for executing the server.

## Tools needed for the install
* `wget`

## Install
* git clone https://github.com/nikkelarsson/Minecraft-Server-Download.git

## Usage
* Use `chmod +x mcservertool.sh` to enable execution rights 
* Execute `./mcservertool.sh` to download the server.jar
* Once the download is complete, two files should be in your current folder `server.jar` and `launch.sh`
* Use `launch.sh` to start the server (the script enables exe-rights to the `launch.sh` automatically)

Happy minecrafting!
